### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Vishal Katti, Business Analytics Advisor, OE-SSHE Data Analytics Group based out of Bangalore, India. I am a father to a hyperactive 2 year old daughter, which has its own rewards. While I have been an active user of R language and recently started using Python, I am fairly comfortable with Github/GitLab and version control.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few automations to help OE-SSHE DAG eliminate some manually created reports and stewardship processes. I am trying to standardise and improve the entire report delivery process.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to use R to create reproducible reports and HTML dashboards

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Python more effectively and sharpening my skill in R and building Shiny Apps

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deploying my R/Shiny and Python apps in OpenShift.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on automating reports and creating dashboards using R.

ðŸ˜„ I'm more than willing to teach R to anyone who wishes to learn.

âš¡ I am an Instrumentation & Control Engineer by education but always inclined towards  Analysis and Report Optimization.
